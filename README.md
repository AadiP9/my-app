- **Smart Route Optimization**: Find optimal routes based on current conditions
- **Incident Management**: Report and track traffic incidents in real-time
- **Public Transport Integration**: Alternative route suggestions including public transport
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive traffic analytics and insights
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, CSS3
- **Backend**: Appwrite (Database, Authentication, Functions, Realtime)
- **AI/ML**: Custom prediction algorithms
- **Deployment**: Appwrite Sites

## 🚦 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Appwrite account and project
- Appwrite API key (for database setup)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
